# Welcome to the Annual Joint Biostatistics Symposium 2025

The Joint Biostatistics Symposium, held annually in mid-April, is a pivotal one-day event that serves as a\
cornerstone for collaboration and knowledge dissemination among faculty and students from the Ohio State University, Case Western Reserve University, and the Cleveland Clinic. The close physical proximity of the three institutions enables attendees to conveniently commute to the venue within 2 hours, facilitating participation and fostering collaboration. Its primary objective is to facilitate communication and engagement surrounding the latest developments and innovations in the field of biostatistics. By providing a platform for researchers, educators, and students to convene, the symposium fosters an environment conducive to sharing cutting-edge research findings, exploring emerging methodologies, and discussing pertinent challenges and opportunities in the realm of biostatistics. Through collaborative discussions, presentations, and networking opportunities, attendees are empowered to stay abreast of the most recent advances in biostatistical research and to forge connections that drive interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.\
\
The Joint Biostatistics Symposium is traditionally hosted on a rotating basis by the Ohio State University (Statistics, Biostatistics, and Biomedical Informatics), the Cleveland Clinic (Quantitative Health Sciences), and Case Western Reserve University (Population and Quantitative Health Sciences). On April 7, 2025, Case Western Reserve University will have the honor of hosting the symposium in the Tinkham Veale Center at Case Western Reserve University, offering a valuable opportunity to uphold our commitments and maintain this vital platform. **We warmly invite researchers from all institutions---especially those specializing in statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, bioinformatics, public health, and related fields---to join us for this exciting meeting. We look forward to your valuable contributions!**
